Because I know the plan facilities, I told the contractor there’s probably no lead involved.
The contractor said according to company procedures, all paint shall be considered lead. I ended up in an heated discussion with the contractor and company Management.
I did some testing with lead sticks and didn’t find any. However, I was told to just finish the job as if it was lead. It took us 3 days to do it, instead of half-day. 
I’m still trying to find out who wrote the policy and didn’t add “until proven otherwise.”

Somehow the thin red book with a few safety rules has grown to be this thick safety book with a ton of rules. We're now supposed to remember 12 life-saving rules.
I remember the safety meeting when these 12 rules were introduced. Idea came from a Dupont best practice. Well, woopy ding. Who cares about Dupont? I care about us.
The safety officer was full of piss and vinegar presenting the 12. At the end, the vets in the room looked at each other and smirked. Sorry, but nothing new here. We couldn't get excited. Nameless at the back summed it up: we can boil this crap down to one rule - use common sense.

The forklift operator was a strong safety person. Head of the safety committee, 1st Aid attendant – a really safety-conscious guy.
He’s picking up 7 plates 20’ long, 6’ wide. Needs a big forklift and has done this job 30-40 times.
There are welding screens in the shop. As he’s coming into the shop with the forklift, out of the corner of his eye, he sees a guy. He slams on the forklift brakes to stop. His action causes the plates to slide off the forklift.  The back wheels of the forklift are in the air, throwing him off the seat.
I ran over and found him on the ground, non-responsive. I grabbed him partially by one arm to get him out of danger. There were plates scattered all around but luckily none landed on him.
He broke his leg, arm, had a concussion. Later, my brain started thinking  - did I grab him by his broken arm? Did I put myself in danger at the time? You don’t think about these at the time.
He’s back to work now.

We had set up to remove equipment on the completion of the job from the different floors using the elevator shaft (elevator not yet installed). We put them into  gal drums.  My job was to swing the barrel at the bottom of the elevator shaft to let the crane pick it up.
Painters were on the job. One put a plank across an inside corner of the elevator shaft to do some painting. The next load knocked the plank down. It hit me and broke my hard hat, my nose, and knocked me out. I woke up in the hospital.-Nose job","UTF-8","",TRUE,"Centre","T","L","LT","Centre"

I took it off the get the work done, a 10 minute job. I later spoke to the safety guy and explained what I had done. He said if you had fallen into the pit, the safety harness would help to lift you out. 
There was no anchor point to connect the harness. Perhaps it needs to re-engineered.

The job called for me to stand on the edge reaching over to work on removing bolts.  If I were to fall, the harness wouldn’t really help me. The lanyard was too long and there was nothing to tie onto to shorten it. I felt I was more in danger wearing a harness.
I took it off the get the work done, a 10 minute job. I later spoke to the safety guy and explained what I had done. He said if you had fallen into the pit, the safety harness would help to lift you out. 
There was no anchor point to connect the harness. Perhaps it needs to re-engineered.
